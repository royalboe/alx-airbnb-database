# 📄 SQL Joins Task — Airbnb Clone Project

## ✅ Task Description

**Objective:** Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

**Instructions:**

- Write a query using an **INNER JOIN** to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.
- Write a query using a **LEFT JOIN** to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.
- Write a query using a **FULL OUTER JOIN** to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

## 💡 What I Worked On

As part of this task for my Airbnb clone project, I focused on writing and practicing advanced SQL join queries to strengthen my understanding of relational database design and data retrieval.  

I successfully:

- Created an **INNER JOIN** query to combine bookings with their corresponding users.
- Wrote a **LEFT JOIN** query to list all properties (listings) along with their reviews, ensuring that properties without reviews are also included.
- Developed a **FULL OUTER JOIN** query to display all users and all bookings, even when there is no direct link between them.

## 🚀 Purpose

These queries are essential for efficiently retrieving combined data from multiple tables, which is a common requirement in real-world applications like an Airbnb clone (e.g., showing all bookings with user info, displaying listings with or without reviews).
